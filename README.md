Pawth is a minimalist view centric PHP framework.


Pawth is more of a 'barebones' web application then a framework. Pawth is not meant to compete with large 
generic frameworks. It exists because often those frameworks are more then is needed for most applications. 
So developers spend a lot of time hacking around the core code to achieve their end goals.

The primary goals of Pawth are to give developers a simple foundation to write most web applications. 
Developers should not need to change core code and the core code should not restrict the developers choice of how to
write code.
